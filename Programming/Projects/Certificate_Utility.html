        <h1>Welcome To The New Office Security App. Certificate Utility, A Free For All Uses App That Uses Closed Source Code For Extra Security</h1>
        <p>Within This App You Can Create Files To Secure Data When Transfering Across Non Secured FTP Services.</p>
        <p>As Long As Both Sides Of The FTP Service Have The App Installed You Can Lock Files To Prevent A <a class="Lnk" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">MITM</a> Attack.</p>
        <p>By Using This Utility You Can Stop MITM Attacks Dead In Their Tracks By Using The Files Created.</p>
        <p>There Is Even Another File That Can Be Used Within A Company Environment, The .MCF File</p>
        <p>.MCF Are Single Files That Can Lock/Unlock Files To protect Sensitive Data Such As Staff Information Files, And Yes It Works On Every File You Have Permission To Access, Even Non Standard Files</p>
        <p>All Certificate Files Are Password Protected And Have An Expiry Date, Not Even I Have Access To Them. So Rest Assured Your Data Is Safe</p>
        <h2>How Does It Work</h2>
        <h3>File Transfer Certificates</h3>
        <p>When You Open The App You Can Create Two Security Files .FSF And .FCF</p>
        <p>The FSF File Is For The Server Side Of Who Is Hosting FTP, The FCF Is Client Side Or Who Is Connecting</p>
        <p>The 2 Files Are Created On The Server Side And Then You Transfer It Over (USB Memory Stick Prefferbly) To The Client Machine</p>
        <p>By Locking/Encrypting The Files Before Sending The Attacker Cannot Read The Data/Files Sent Therefore All Files And Data Are Still Secure</p>
        <h3>Standard Certificates</h3>
        <p>To Use This Feature You Will Need To Generate The File Needed By Filling Out The Boxes With Relevent Information.</p>
        <p>Once Exported You Can Then Import The File By Entering The Password Into The Pasword Box And Clicking On Import</p>
        <p>If Any Certificate Is Expired You Can Still Unlock Files However You Will No Longer Be Able To Lock Files, This Apples To All Certificate Files</p>
